Oh, the lizard, a wizard with dreams untamed,
Yearned for a gizzard, its longing unclaimed.
To be like a chicken, that was its desire,
To peck at the ground and set hearts afire.

But alas, fate played a mischievous hand,
Turning its magic into something unplanned.
A hybrid it became, a peculiar sight,
A lizard-chicken, a curious delight.

With scales and feathers, an oddity unique,
It clucked and squawked, both humble and chic.
A wizard in disguise, casting spells anew,
Adding wonder and laughter to the barnyard crew.

The other chickens puzzled, bewildered they stared,
At this creature of magic, the wizardly flair.
Yet, the lizard embraced its peculiar fate,
Finding joy in the blend, neither early nor late.

For in this odd fusion, a lesson was found,
That being oneself is where true magic's crowned.
So the lizard, the wizard, the chicken entwined,
Brought laughter and mirth to all they'd find.

With gizzard or not, it found its own way,
In the realm of enchantment, forever to stay.
And the barnyard rejoiced in its whimsical grace,
As the lizard, a wizard, brought smiles to each face.
